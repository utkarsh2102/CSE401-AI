    "If we tried to solve this problem using a brute-force approach, we would look at every combination of items available to be put in the knapsack. For the mathematically inclined, this is known as a powerset, and a powerset of a set (in our case, the set of items) has $2^{N}$ different possible subsets, where $N$ is the number of items. Therefore, we would need to analyze $2^{N}$ combinations $(O(2^{N}))$. This is okay for a small number of items, but it is untenable for a large number. Any approach that solves a problem\n",

As long as the capacity of the knapsack is considered in discrete steps, the problem can be solved with dynamic programming."
